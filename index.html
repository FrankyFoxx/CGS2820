<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; color:purple"><i>Who we are and what we do</i></h2>
   <p style="font-size:14px">A mysterious, dimly lit curiosity shop dealing in rare magical artifacts, <br>
   ethically sourced bones,enchanted trinkets, and cursed‑object rehabilitation. <br>
   They also offer “curse detox” services for tourists who accidentally buy something <br>
   they shouldn’t.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; color:purple"><i>A little history about The Salem Oddities & Enchantments </i></h2>
  <p style="font-size:14px">Blackthorn began as a traveling wagon in the early 1800s, run by the enigmatic <br>
  witch siblings Cassian and Liora Blackthorn. When they settled in Salem in 1837, <br>
  they opened a permanent storefront. Over the years, the shop became known for its <br>
  strict ethical code: no stolen relics, no grave‑robbing, and no curses without consent. <br>
  The Blackthorn line is said to have died out, but the current owner—who appeared in <br>
  Salem seemingly out of nowhere—claims to be a distant relative.</p>
