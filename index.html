            A mysterious, dimly lit curiosity shop dealing in rare magical artifacts,<br>
            ethically sourced bones, enchanted trinkets, and cursed‑object rehabilitation.<br>
            They also offer “curse detox” services for tourists who accidentally buy something<br>

    <h2><i>A little history about The Salem Oddities & Enchantments</i></h2>
    <img src="images/blackthorn.png" alt="Blackthorn Witch" class="body-img">

    <p>
        Blackthorn began as a traveling wagon in the early 1800s, run by the enigmatic<br>
        witch siblings Cassian and Liora Blackthorn. When they settled in Salem in 1837,<br>
        they opened a permanent storefront. Over the years, the shop became known for its<br>
        strict ethical code: no stolen relics, no grave‑robbing, and no curses without consent.<br>
        The Blackthorn line is said to have died out, but the current owner—who appeared in<br>
        Salem seemingly out of nowhere—claims to be a distant relative.
